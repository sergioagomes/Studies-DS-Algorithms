# Basics

## Big O Time Complexity

- What is Big O

Big O is a way to categorize your algorithms time or memory requirements based on input.

Ex: When someone says Oh of N, they mean your algorithm will grow linearily based on input

- Why do we use it ?

Help us to make decisions about what data structures and algorithms to use, knowing how they will perform can greatly help create the best possible program out here.

Big O - as your input grows, how fast does computation or memory grow?

- grow is with respect to the input
- constants are dropped
- worst case is usually the way we measure


## Arrays Data Structure

- Arrays has fixed size, continiguous memory chunks
- we can't grow it
- there's no insert or push or pop an arrays
