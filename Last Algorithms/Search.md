## Linear Search

**Search/Linear Search**

- Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a collection (such as a list or array) until a match is found or all elements have been checked
- Linear search is O(N) - time complexity
- Linear search is O(1) - space complexity
- Useful when:
  - the collection is small
  - when there is a need to find the first occurence of an element

**Binary Search Algorithm**

- Binary search is a algorithm for finding a target value within a sorte array/list of elements, it's works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- Binary search is O(log n) - time complexity
- Binary search is O(1) - space complexity
